I chose this dataset for my final project because, for many people worldwide, online learning was a pain in the leg as not everyone worldwide had good technology and internet connectivity to join online meetings. So I wanted to know how COVID-19 impacted student's learning, and what factors impacted the most. 

List of questions:

1. What is the average age of the participants?

2. Is there a correlation between the time spent on online classes and the rating of the online class experience?

3. Which medium is most commonly used for online classes?

4. Is there a relationship between the preferred social media platform and the time spent on social media?

5. Is there any correlation between time spent on self-study and the rating of online class experience?

6. What is the average number of meals per day for participants?

7. How many participants reported health issues during the lockdown?

8. What are the common stress busters reported by participants?

9. Which social media platform is most preferred by the participants?

10. Is there a correlation between the change in weight and the time spent on fitness?
